Repository layout for Vercel deployment:

- `app/` Next.js App Router UI and routes.
- `app/routes/chat/route.ts` Frontend API route that converts AI SDK UI messages and forwards to the Python function.
- `api/python-chat.py` Python serverless function (FastAPI + LangChain).
- `requirements.txt` Python dependencies.
- `vercel.json` Configures Python runtime and build commands.

## Getting Started

First, run the development servers:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

1. Push to a Git repo, import into Vercel.
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in Vercel Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables.
